# Suggestions
- Cancellation rates rise as the price does. To prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels 
could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on 
locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
- As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the 
resort hotel than the city hotels. So, the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the 
room prices on weekends or on holidays.
- In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable 
amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
- They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to 
reduce the cancellation rate.
